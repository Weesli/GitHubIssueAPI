# GitHub Issue Discord bot

 **What is this ?**

When your users open a request (bug, request, etc.) from one of your Discord form channels, this allows you to automatically open it as an issue on GitHub.

**Why should I use this?**

Some users prefer to create issues directly on Discord rather than on GitHub. By opening these issues on GitHub, you can manage bugs in your projects more efficiently and perform commit operations in a more organized manner.

**Requirements for use**

- Discord bot
- Hosting to run the Discord bot (may already be available)
- GitHub user token (see GitHub token help for instructions on obtaining one)
- Active form system on your Discord server

**Setup**

```
git clone https://github.com/Weesli/GitHubIssueDiscordBot.git
cd GitHubIssueDiscordBot
// If you already have TypeScript on your computer, you don't need to install it.
npm install -g typescript
// to build
npm run build
// to start
npm run start
```
